# Assembly-Based File Encryption and Decryption Program
#### What is the Project?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project involves developing a low-level file encryption and decryption functionality using MASM. The program will have a user input a file, along with a key that will be used to encrypt and decrypt the file. This functionality will be obtained through the use of an XOR cipher, of which will symmetrically encrypt and decrypt the data. The XOR cipher works by toggling the bits of the data file based on the user provided key. This will make the data unreadable without the proper decryption key.

#### Why is this project useful?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project will allow us to implement a low level symmetric encryption method in Assembly through the use of direct manipulation of the inputted fileâ€™s data. This project will also require the use of file-handling within Assembly, useful subject matter within any programming language. This project also highlights the challenges and benefits of using an Assembly language for security related purposes, aiding in our cybersecurity related degrees. 

#### What are some potential challenges related to this project?
*File Input and Output:* <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a low level, file manipulation can prove difficult, as we- the programmers- are solely responsible for ensuring that the files are handled properly and there are no mistakes within the program logic. <br/><br/>
*Memory Management:* <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, as the programmers we are solely responsible for the proper handling of data. With larger files, this could prove very difficult and will require meticulous planning and testing. <br/><br/>
*Error Handling:* <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will be required to handle any errors that may occur (e.g. errors related to file access, memory allocation, invalid keys). This will give us a lot of experience dealing with the Assembly debugging tools and ensuring our program logic is sound. <br/><br/>
